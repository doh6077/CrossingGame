## Crossing Game
Crossing Game is a simple Python game built using the Pygame library. In this game, players control two characters who need to cross a road while avoiding oncoming cars. The objective is to reach the finish line and collect keys along the way.

# Installation
Before running the game, you'll need to set up the required dependencies:

Python: Make sure you have Python installed. You can download it from python.org.

# How to Play
To play Crossing Game:

- Run the crossing_game.py script.

-Player 1 is controlled using the arrow keys (Up and Down), while Player 2 is controlled using the 'W' and 'S' keys.

- The objective of the game is to safely guide your characters across the road to reach the finish line at the top of the screen.

- To enhance your chances of success, collect keys along the way by colliding with them.

- Be cautious and avoid colliding with oncoming cars; a collision with a car will result in the end of the game.

- Once one of the players collects a key, the cars for that particular stage will disappear, providing a temporary advantage.

- Your score increases as both players successfully reach the finish line, and you'll find that the game becomes progressively more challenging as you advance.
